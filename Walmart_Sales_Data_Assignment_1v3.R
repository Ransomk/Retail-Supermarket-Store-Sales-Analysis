# Due to the markdown and discounts during holiday the $ dollar amount (Price) of any given product is lesser. 
# This means that while there could be a possibility that actual units sold were higher during holidays 
# The final dollar value of the Sales can actually be lesser or equal the Non discounted sales value during the normal period.
# So this comparison is dependent upon the amount of Holiday discount.
# A better measure to compare the impact of Holiday discounts on the Sales compared to Non-Holiday weeks would be 
# to compare actual units of goods sold across categories between the two periods(Holiday v/s Non-Holiday). 
# But this information is not currently available in the data-set provided for this analysis.

# Insights based on the Semester classification of data indicates following points:
# 1. On Average the 2nd Semester sales are higher than 1st Semester. Except for in the year 2012.  
#    This is logically conclusive as well since the monthly analysis validates that sales on average is higher in Nov and Dec months which fall in 2nd Semester.
#    Note that for 2012-2nd Semester data is incomplete as data was available only till October 2012. And as noted in monthly analysis the November and December month average sales tend to be the highest of all months in the year.
#    But there is not a large difference/disparity in the average weekly sales between the semesters.
#    Range of Average weekly sales is 1002080 to 1087128.
#    The lowest average weekly sales was recorded in the 1st Semester of 2011 and The highest was recorded in the 2nd Semester of 2011.
# 2. Note that again we see a high variance/sd of weekly sales in the 2nd Semester with a large number of outliers.
#    This again follows from our conclusion in Monthly sales analysis which revealed high number of outliers for weekly sales figures in Nov and Dec.
